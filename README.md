# AIEO Project

This project uses the following structure:

- `docker/` - Docker-related files (e.g., docker-compose.yml)
- `mlflow/` - MLflow artifact storage
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks and experiments
- `src/` - Source code (e.g., training scripts)
- `.env` - Environment variables

## Getting Started

1. Configure your environment variables in `.env`.
2. Use `docker/docker-compose.yml` to set up services.
3. Store MLflow artifacts in `mlflow/`.
4. Place notebooks in `notebooks/`.
5. Add source code to `src/`.
